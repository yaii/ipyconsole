# ipyconsole #

An IPython console in GTK.

## Dependencies ##

* pygtk
* Bundled with IPython 0.8.4

The API for later versions of IPython changed. Its probably possible to port but the IPython API changes a lot and it would also mean more dependencies.

## Missing ##

Some keys related features for IPython are not there yet. Like pressing up/down for completing a line.

History and table completion do work though.
